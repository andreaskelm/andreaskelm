# Hey, I’m Andreas 👋

**Product Manager | Systems Thinker | Currently on Garden Leave**

I build systems that make product teams less chaotic and more effective. Less theory, more “here’s exactly how to do it.”

## 🧠 What I’m Building

### [PM Brain System](link-to-your-repo)

Your external product management brain. A living knowledge base that bridges the gap between PM frameworks and actual operational execution.

**The problem:** Product teams drown in blog posts, frameworks, and aspirational best practices—but still don’t know *how* to run sprint planning on Tuesday morning or write a PRD by EOD.

**The solution:** Git-versioned, battle-tested guides, templates, and playbooks. Single source of truth = latest commit. Built for everyone from junior PMs to senior leads.

```
📦 What's Inside
├── Frameworks that actually help you decide
├── Step-by-step operational guides
├── Copy-paste ready templates
├── Scenario-based playbooks for when shit hits the fan
└── Company context that doesn't go stale
```

**Why GitHub?** Version control for knowledge. No more “wait, is this doc current?” moments. No more Confluence chaos.

## 💭 My Philosophy

**On Product Management:**

- Good process enables autonomy, bad process creates bureaucracy
- Documentation is a team sport, not a chore
- The best framework is the one your team actually uses
- Junior PMs shouldn’t have to reverse-engineer how things work

**On Knowledge Systems:**

- If it’s not version controlled, it will drift
- Single source of truth > duplicated information
- Operational knowledge > theoretical frameworks
- Make the right thing the easy thing

**On Garden Leave:**

- You can either doomscroll or build systems
- Free time + PM brain = dangerous productivity
- Systematizing 10 years of learnings = surprisingly therapeutic

## 🌱 Random Facts

- I’ve onboarded [X] PMs and realized I was repeating myself verbatim
- My Notion workspace got too complex, so I nuked it and moved to git
- Garden leave is basically a paid sabbatical to systematize everything
- I unironically enjoy writing documentation
- This GitHub profile is what happens when a PM has too much free time
