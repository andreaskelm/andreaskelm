# Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I build hands-on product management systems that make product teams more effective. Less theory, more "here's *exactly* how to do it."

I ship copy-paste frameworks and templates for the messy reality of product work—not the idealized version.

## 🏗️ What I'm Building

### 🧠 [PM brain-as-code](https://github.com/andreaskelm/pm-brain/) 


A git-versioned knowledge base that turns PM frameworks into actual operational playbooks. When you need to run sprint planning on Tuesday morning or write a strategy document by end-of-day, this gives you the exact steps, templates, and battle-tested guides—not just theory.

Built for product teams who want a single source of truth that stays current. Clone it, add your company context, and start shipping.
