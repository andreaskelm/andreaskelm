# Hi, I'm Andreas 👋

I build hands-on product management systems that make product teams more effective. Less theory, more "here's *exactly* how to do it."

I ship copy-paste frameworks and templates for the messy reality of product work—not the idealized version.

## 🧠 What I'm Building

### [PM Brain-as-code](https://github.com/andreaskelm/pm-brain/)

Your external product management brain. A living knowledge base that bridges the gap between PM frameworks and actual operational execution.

📦 **Ready-to-use:** clone the repo, add your context, start shipping

**The problem:** Product teams drown in blog posts, frameworks, and aspirational best practices—but still don't know *how* to run sprint planning on Tuesday morning or write a Product Requirements Document by end-of-day.

**The solution:** Git-versioned, battle-tested guides, templates, and playbooks. Single source of truth = latest commit. Built for everyone from junior PMs to senior leads.

```
📦 What's Inside
├── 🧭 Frameworks that actually help you decide
├── 📋 Step-by-step operational guides
├── 📄 Copy-paste ready templates
├── 🚨 Scenario-based playbooks for when shit hits the fan
└── 🏢 Company context that doesn't go stale
```

## 💭 Why This Exists

I've onboarded 20+ PMs and realized I was repeating myself verbatim. Every team reinvents the same wheels—how to write a PRD, run discovery, prioritize a backlog. 

This is the system I wish I'd had as a junior PM. Battle-tested across Danske Commodities, Vertica, and BESTSELLER. Now version-controlled so it doesn't go stale.
